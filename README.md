# Class exercise: TDD
1. Clone this project
2. Take a look at the following files:
    1. IDAO
    2. EmployeeDAO
    3. IEmployeeDAO
    4. IDAOTest
3. Now let the EmployeeDAO implement the IEmployeeDAO interface
4. From within the IEmployeeDAO interface create a new test file
5. Set up the new test file with data and an IEmployeeDAO reference (like its done in IDAO)
6. Now implement a test method to test the first interface method (getEmployeesByName)
    - The method is not yet implemented in EmployeeDAO
7. Run the test and see it fail
8. Implement the method -> run the test again -> now it should be green
9. Refactor if necessary
10. Run steps 6-9 again for each IEmployeeDAO method# repo auto created
